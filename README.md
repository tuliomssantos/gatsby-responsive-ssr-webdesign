#   Gatsby Responsive Webdesign

Rendering on the server, or in build, and media queries on the client side are fundamentally conflicting and impose the need for design choice.

To ensure that an application on Gatsby is fully responsive we can use the library @ artsy / fresnel and ensure that all display possibilities are pre-rendered.

```sh
  yarn add @artsy/fresnel
```
